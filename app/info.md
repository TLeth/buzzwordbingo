# Buzzwordbingo

## Rules

The rules are simple:
- When you hear a word on your card, then you mark it.
- When all the words on your card are marked, you have BINGO!
- You win if you are the first one to get BINGO.

How you celebrate getting BINGO is up to you, but traditionally BINGO is accompanied with a loud "BINGO!"
